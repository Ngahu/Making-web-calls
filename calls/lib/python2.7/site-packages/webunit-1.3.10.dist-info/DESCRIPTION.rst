Webunit is a framework for unit testing websites:

- Browser-like page fetching including fetching the images and stylesheets
  needed for a page and following redirects
- Cookies stored and trackable (all automatically handled)
- HTTP, HTTPS, GET, POST, basic auth all handled, control over expected
  status codes, ...
- DOM parsing of pages to retrieve and analyse structure, including simple
  form re-posting
- Two-line page-fetch followed by form-submit possible, with error checking
- Ability to register error page content across multiple tests
- Uses python's standard unittest module as the underlying framework
- May also be used to regression-test sites, or ensure their ongoing
  operation once in production (testing login processes work, etc.)
